        <h1>Day 4 Interview Questions</h1>
    <h2> 1. How many operators do we have in JS?</h2>
    <p> 
      <span> Ans.</span> Operator can manipulate a certain value or operand. Operators are basically used to 
      perform some specific mathematical and logical computation on operands. In another words we can say that 
      operator operates the operands. There are many operators but few of them are Assignment, Arithmetic, 
      Logical, Relational, Bitwise, Comparison operator and many more...
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      let a = 5,b = 5, d = 3;
      let c = a + b;
      d += 8
      console.log('Value of c =>',c)
      console.log('Value of d =>',d)
      if (a == b)
        console.log('Both are equals')
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
        Value of c => 10
        Value of d => 11
        Both are equals
    </pre>
    <h2> 2. What are pure functions? </h2>
    <p>
       <span> Ans.</span> Pure function is a function that always returns the same result if the same 
       arguments are passed. In another words  it is a function that would give same or consistent output 
       if same input is being passed. It is nothing but a well defined function.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      function add(a,b){
        console.log(a+b);
      }
      add(3,4)
      add(3,4)
      add(7,5)
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      7
      7
      12
    </pre>
    <h2> 3. What is callback hell? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Call back hell is a nested callback stacked below one another, in other words it 
      is a function that will execute after execution of its parent function is executed completely. It also 
      form pyramid like structure that is difficult to understand and debug. We should avoid using callback 
      hell as much as possible.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      function printNum(){
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log('5')
          setTimeout(() => {
            console.log('4')
            setTimeout(() => {
              console.log('3')
              setTimeout(() => {
                console.log('2')
                setTimeout(() => {
                  console.log('1')
                },1000)
              },2000)
            },3000)
          }, 4000)
        }, 5000);
      }
      printNum()

      1
    </pre>
    <h2> 4. What are promises and why do we need them? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Promises is like heaven for callbacks. It is introduced in ES6 version to handle 
      a asynchronous operations in an efficient way. It debug and manage code we need promises. It is 
      basically used to find out if the asynchronous operation is successfully completed or not. A promise 
      may have one of the three states that is pending, fulfilled or rejected. Promises allows us to write 
      cleaner code and allows error to pass down the chain and can be handled in a common place.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      var promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if(5 === 5) 
          resolve();
        else 
          reject();
      });
         
      promise.
          then(function () {
              console.log('Success,  Both are equals');
          }).
          catch(function () {
              console.log('Some error, both are not equals');
          });
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      Success,  Both are equals
    </pre>
    <h2> 5. What is promise chaining? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Promise chaining are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous 
      operation where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmageable code. To avoid callback 
      hell  we can use promise chaining. It is basically when multiple use of .then method are used.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      const printNum = (time, value) => {
        return new Promise ((resolved, rejected) => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(time)
            resolved();
          }, time);
        })
      }
      
      printNum(5000, '5')
         .then(() => printNum(4000, '4'))
         .then(() => printNum(3000, '3'))
         .then(() => printNum(2000, '2'))
         .then(() => printNum(1000, '1'))
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      5000
      4000
      3000
      2000
      1000
    </pre>
    <h2> 6. Give an example of async/await? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Async and await are introduced in ES8 version of JavaScript which return a promise. 
      Await is also a function which waits for a promise.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      const printNum = (time, value) => {
        return new Promise ((resolved, rejected) => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(value)
            resolved();
          }, time);
        })
      }
      
      async function newfunc(){
        await printNum(5000, '5')
        await printNum(4000, '4')
        await printNum(3000, '3')
        await printNum(2000, '2')
        await printNum(1000, '1')
      }
      newfunc()
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      5
      4
      3
      2
      1
    </pre>
    <h2> 7. What is the purpose of async/await keywords? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Async and await both are keywords which are basically brothers and sisters or 
      siblings basically wherever async keyword goes await follows it. To avoid using much promises we 
      have this best alternative basically to write the code in simplified manner that would make the code 
      more readable and understandable and to avoid callback hell and promises we use async and await.
