        <h1>Day 3 Interview Questions</h1>
    <h2> 1. What is the use of setTimeout?</h2>
    <p> 
      <span> Ans.</span> The setTimeout() method executes a block of code after specified time. Basically 
      if we want a output after some specified time we can set the time for that block of code in the 
      setTimeout function and through this we can get the output with a delay of whatever time set. This 
      method executes the code only once and 1 second = 1000 millisecond.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      setTimeout( ()=>{
        console.log("Hello world")
      }, 3000);
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      Hello world 
     ( after 3 sec it will print )
    </pre>
    <h2> 2. What is an event loop and call stack?</h2>
    <p>
       <span> Ans.</span> The setTimeout, setInterval, fetch, console these are not inbuild JavaScript 
       function. These are the part of web API to make JavaScript asynchronous and which are being given 
       by browser to JavaScript to perform some task. JavaScript does not have anything, it just have a 
       single thread or you can call it a main thread where it is executing the code all at once even if 
       it is a million lines of code.
    </p>
    <p>Event loop is nothing but a gatekeeper or a method that keeps on monitoring your call stack and call 
      back queue. If any task is there in call back queue that needs to be executed then  it checks in the 
      global execution context is there in call stack is empty or not, if empty then it pushes the task that 
      need to be exactuted into the call stack.</p>
    <p>Call stack is also called control stack and runtime stack. Everything happens in the JavaScript happens 
      in the execution context. When we run a specific code it create a global execution context inside 
      the call stack. In global execution context all the code get executed and if there is any function 
      call then a new function execution context will get created on call stack and the code inside that 
      will execute, if there is any other function call then another function execution context would be 
      created like this it would be going on. After that finally the code would get executed in the function 
      execution context then it would be poped out one by one on the basis of last in first out. This way all 
      the execution on call stack would be poped out and after we get the output the global execution context 
      will also be poped out from the call stack.</p>
      <pre class="pre">

        var a = 10;
        function add(x,y){
            console.log(x+y)
        }
        add(2,3)
        add(4,5)
  
        console.log(a)
      </pre>
      <p class="output">Output :</p>
      <pre>
        5
        9
        10
      </pre>
    <h2> 3. What are arrow functions? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Arrow function is the newest feature introduced ES6 version of JS, to write simple 
      and manageable code that is easy to debug and understand.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      let arrow = () => {
        console.log("This is a Arrow function");
      }
      arrow();
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      This is a Arrow function
    </pre>
    <h2> 4. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> If you are accessing any variable before its declaration and that variable is 
      defined using let and const keywords then you will be getting a  reference error because the variable 
      is in temporal dead zone. To avoid Temporal dead zone, try to access a variable after its declaration 
      and initialisation.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      console.log(a);
      let a = "hello";
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      Error: Cannot access 'a' before initialization at Object.
    </pre>
    <h2> 5. What is hoisting?</h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Hosting is a behaviour of JavaScript where all the variables are move of the top 
      of declaration. In other words we can say that we can use the variables and functions in JavaScript 
      before declaring them. Var keyword only support hoisting let and const keyword doesn't support hoisting.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      console.log(a)
      var a = "hello"
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      undefined
    </pre>
    <h2> 6. What is the DOM? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> DOM (Document object model), JavaScript support DOM as a structure of Hierarchy.
      Document = HTML  -> HEAD  and BODY. Methods to access the DOM elements are by id, by class name, 
      by tag name and by query selector. In query selector we can use ID, class and tag name.
    </p>
    <h2> 7. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> These all are the properties of JavaScript. 
      <p>Undefined is when we try to access a variable which is existing in the memory space but hasn't been 
        assigned any value till now. Basically if the variable is declared using var keyword, but not given 
        any value to it and we try to access it before declaring do we will get undefined.</p> 
      
      <p>Not defined is when we try to access a variable which is does not exist in memory space basically 
        if the value is not initialised or declared and we are still trying to access that variable using let 
        and const then we will get not defined.</p>
      
      <p>NAN is a data type when we are trying to access any string and number, to check if it is a string 
        or a number then it will throw you an NAN error.</p>
