        <h1>Day 5 Interview Questions</h1>
    <h2> 1. What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax?</h2>
    <p> 
      <span> Ans.</span> In JavaScript the for-in loop is a basic control statement that allows you to loop 
      through all the properties of an object. The statements of code found within the loop body will be 
      executed on once for each property of the object.
    </p>
    <p class="output"> Syntax :</p>
    <pre >

      for (variable in object){
        //statements
      }
    </pre>
    <pre class="pre">

      const student = {
        name: 'Monica',
        class: 7,
        age: 12
      }
      for ( let key in student ) {
        console.log(key,` => `,student[key]);
      }
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
      <pre>
        name  =>  Monica
        class  =>  7
        age  =>  12
      </pre>
    
    <h2> 2. Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript? </h2>
    <p>
       <span> Ans.</span> In global scope variables are declared outside of all functions are known as global 
        variables and in a global scope. Global variables are accessible anywhere in the program.
    </p>
    <p>In functional scope variables that are declared inside a function are called local variables and in a 
       functional scope. Local variables are accessible anywhere inside the function.</p>

    <p>Local scope it is basically similar to functional scope has local scope is defined inside functional 
       scope but inside brackets opening and closing { }.</p>

    <p>In block scope variable that are declared inside a specific block and can't be accessed outside of 
       the block. In order to access the variable of that specific block we need to create object for it.</p>

    <p>JavaScript engine uses scopes to find out the exact location or accessibility of variable that 
       particular process is known as scope chain.</p>

    <h2> 3. What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Null and undefined both are keywords used in JavaScript. Null is the intentional 
      absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript. Undefined means the value does 
      not exist in the compiler. It is the Global object.
    </p>
    <p>We use null when we have to define a variable and we have to make it programmatically empty and 
      undefined is used when we have to define the variable but don't have any use right now so we just 
      make that variable using var keyword and we don't not use it currently.</p>

      <pre class="pre">

        let name = null;
        var temp;
        if(name == null && temp === undefined)
          console.log("true");
        else
          console.log("false");
      </pre>
      <p class="output">Output :</p>
      <pre>
        true
      </pre>

    <h2> 4. what is Symbol? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Symbols are introduced in ES6 version of JavaScript a new primitive data type of 
      JavaScript like string,  number, boolean, etc. Basically symbol is a building object whose constructor 
      returns a symbol also called symbol value that guarantees to be unique and immutable 
      ( cannot be changed ). You can create symbol by calling the symbol ( )  Global factory function.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      let id = Symbol("id");
      let person = {
          name: "Jack",
          [id]: 123 
      };
      console.log(person); 
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
       { name: 'Jack', [Symbol(id)]: 123 }
    </pre>
    <h2> 5. Write code to explain map and filter in arrays? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Map method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function 
      to each one of the element of the first array. Filter method takes each element in an array and 
      it applies a conditional statement against it. If the conditional returns true, the elements get pushed 
      to the output array. If the condition return false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      let n = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      let doubled = n.map(item => item * 2);
      console.log(doubled);

      let num = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      let evens = num.filter(item => item % 2 === 0);
      console.log(evens)
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
       [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]
       [ 2, 4 ]
    </pre>
    <h2> 6. Explain passed by value and passed by reference? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> In Pass by Value, function is called by directly passing the value of the variable 
      as an argument. Basically the parameter passed as an argument creates its own copy. So any changes made 
      inside the function is made to the copied value not to the original value. 
    </p>
    <p>In Pass by Reference function is called by directly passing the reference or address of the variable 
      as an argument. Basically parameter passed as an argument does not create its own copy, it refer to 
      an original value so changes made inside function affect the original value. In JavaScript array and 
      object follows Pass by Reference property.</p>

    <h2> 7. Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Self-invoking functions also called self-executing functions these are nameless 
      anonymous function that is invoked immediately after its definition. These are enclosed inside a set 
      of parentheses followed by another set of parentheses  ( ), which does the execution.
    </p>
  
    <pre class="pre">

      (function(x){
        console.log(x);
      })("Hello, World!");
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      Hello, World!
    </pre>
