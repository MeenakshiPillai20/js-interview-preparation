        <h1>Day 1 Interview Questions</h1>
    <h2> 1. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators? </h2>
    <p> 
      <span> Ans.</span> ==  is equality operator and === is the strict equality operator. ==  checks 
      equality of values of the operands only and === checks equality of values and data types of the operands.
      Basically == does the type conversion of the operands before comparison where as === compare data 
      type as well because it doesn't convert the type before comparison.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      let a = 10;
      let b = '10';

      console.log(a == b);
      console.log(a === b);
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
     <pre>
        true
        false
     </pre>
    <h2> 2. What is the spread operator? </h2>
    <p>
       <span> Ans.</span> Spread operator allows us to copy an existing array or object into another array or object. 
        It can be mainly used in many cases like when you want to expand, copy, concat with Math object,etc.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      let arr = [34,"Meenu",56,87]
      let newArr = [...arr]

      console.log(newArr)
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      [ 34, 'Meenu', 56, 87 ]
    </pre>
    <pre></pre>
    <p></p>
    <h2> 3. What are the differences between var, let and const? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Var, let and const these are the keywords of JavaScript that we use to declare 
      variables or to  assign it to a variable. Var was initially used to declare variable when JavaScript 
      was introduced  and right now in newer versions we have let and const for declaring variables. 

      There are some basic differences
        
      The scope of var variable is global scope whereas The scope of let variable is block or local scope.
      and The scope of constant is also  block or local scope only. Var is global scope because we can access 
      variables from anywhere but let and const are restricted within the block

      Var variable can be modified, re-intialized re-declared into the scope whereas Let variable can 
      be modified but cannot be re-intialized, re-declared into the scope whereas Const variable cannot 
      be modified nor be re-intialized or re-declared into the scope.Const is initialised and declared 
      on the same time.
    </p>

    <h2> 4. What is execution context? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Execution context is used to describe how a code works inside JavaScript.Execution 
      context refers to the environment that allows JavaScript code to be executed. The execution context 
      determines which code, section has access to the code's functions, variables and objects.Everything 
      that happens inside the JavaScript happens in execution context. If write one line of code or 1000 
      line of code execution context always is created. Execution context have two parts that is creation 
      phase and execution phase. In creation phase we have code environment or component and memory component
      Inside creation phase we have memory component and inside execution phase we have code component. 
      Whenever we run a code a global execution context is being created in the call stack. Call stack 
      is also called control stack and runtime stack. So in creation phase that is the memory component, 
      all the variables and functions inside the code are assigned some memory that is undefined.
      Then inside the execution phase that is the code component if there is any variables defined with 
      some values will be assigned to the variable and if there is any function call then a new function 
      execution context is been created inside the global execution context inside the call stack.
      Whenever a function is called inside the code a new function execution context is been created 
      all the time and it would be removed on the basis of last in first out. If in the new  function 
      execution context there is some variable which is not defined then the compiler start searching 
      it inside the global execution context  or the parent execution context. This way inside call 
      stack after the global one by one function execution context created  and the code inside it get 
      executed after that it is it poped out in LIFO basis and finally global execution context also gets 
      removed at Las and finally we get our output.

      var a = 10;
      function add(x,y){
          console.log(x+y)
      }
      add(2,3)
      add(4,5)

      console.log(a)
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>

      10
    </pre>
    <h2> 5. What is meant by first class functions? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> First class function is basically if a function in that language is treated like other variables. 
      So the functions can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or can be returned 
      by another function. JavaScript treat function as a first-class-citizen. This means that functions 
      are simply a value and just another type of object.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">
      
      const greet = () => {
        console.log("Hello")
      }

      greet()
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      Hello
    </pre>
    <h2> 6. What are closures? Give an example of closure? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Closure is a combination of inner function and lexical environment of outer function.In another words 
      closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript closures 
      are created every time a function is created, at functions creation time.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      function outer(){
        let a = 10;
        function inner(){
          console.log(a);
        }
        inner()
      }
      outer()
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      10
    </pre>
    <h2> 7. Explain call( ), apply( ) and, bind( ) methods. Give an example of call( ), apply( ), bind( )? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Call, apply and bind these are just different way of calling or invoking  a function. When you are 
      calling a function using any of these then you don't have to define in the function that the first 
      argument will be an object.

      Call invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments one by one. Apply invokes the function 
      and allows you to pass in arguments as an array. Bind returns a new function, allows you to pass 
      in a array and any number of arguments.
