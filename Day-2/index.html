        <h1>Day 2 Interview Questions</h1>
    <h2> 1. What is creation phase and execution phase? </h2>
    <p> 
      <span> Ans.</span> Everything that happens inside the JavaScript happens in execution context. Execution 
      context have two parts that is creation phase and execution phase. In creation phase we have code 
      environment or component and memory component. Inside creation phase we have memory component and 
      inside execution phase we have code component. Whenever we run a code a global execution context is 
      being created in the call stack. So in creation phase that is the memory component, all the variables 
      and functions inside the code are assigned some memory that is undefined. Then inside the execution 
      phase that is the code component if there is any variables defined with some values will be assigned 
      to the variable and if there is any function call then a new function execution context is been created 
      inside the global execution context inside the call stack. If in the new  function execution context 
      there is some variable which is not defined then the compiler start searching it inside the global 
      execution context  or the parent execution context. This way inside call stack after the global 
      execution stack by one function execution context created  and the code inside it get executed 
      after that it is poped out in LIFO basis and finally global execution context also gets removed 
      at last  and finally we get our output.

    <h2> 2. What are objects in javascript? </h2>
    <p>
       <span> Ans.</span> In javascript,  Object is a non primitive data type that allows you to store 
       multiple collection of data in the form of key value pairs. Objects have many methods inside it 
       we can use in program to simplify our code. For-of loop does not work for object it will throw 
       and error if used. There are three different ways of creating objects:-    
       1.   By object literal 
       2.   By creating instance of object that is using new keyword 
       3.   By object constructor
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">
 
      ---------------------------
      by object literal
      ---------------------------

        let obj = {
          name : "Meenakshi",
          marks : 80
        }
        console.log(obj)
        console.log(obj.name," ",obj.marks);

      -----------------------------------------------
      by creating instance of object
      ------------------------------------------------

        let obj1 = new Object();
        obj1.name = "Poonam";
        obj1.marks = 68;
        console.log(obj1);
        console.log(obj1.name," ",obj1.marks);

      -----------------------------------
      by object constructor
      -----------------------------------

        function Obj(name, marks){
          this.name = name;
          this.marks = marks;
        }
        let obj2 = new Obj("Melvin", 79);
        console.log(obj2);
        console.log(obj2.name," ",obj2.marks);
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      { name: 'Meenakshi', marks: 80 }
      Meenakshi   80
      { name: 'Poonam', marks: 68 }
      Poonam   68
      Obj { name: 'Melvin', marks: 79 }
      Melvin   79
    </pre>
    <h2> 3. What are function constructors? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span>Function is said to be a constructor when it is used to initialise and create 
      a instance of class that is also called as object. It is a good practice to follow to keep the 
      first letter of function name capital. It is compulsory to use this and new keyword.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      function Obj(name, marks){
        this.name = name;
        this.marks = marks;
      }
      let obj2 = new Obj("Melvin", 79);
      console.log(obj2);
      console.log(obj2.name," ",obj2.marks)
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      Obj { name: 'Melvin', marks: 79 }
      Melvin   79
    </pre>
    <h2> 4. Explain prototypes? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Prototype is a special type of object to which we can add additional properties 
      that can be accessed across the all the instances. Prototype is nothing but an object only. Prototype 
      also contains the object prototype inside it. Prototype is itself an object that have prototype object 
      present inside it.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      function Student(name, age, roll){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.roll = roll;
      }
      let stu = new Student("Meenakshi",23,45)
      console.log(stu)
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
   <pre>
    Student {name: 'Meenakshi', age: 23, roll: 45}
      age: 23
      name: "Meenakshi"
      roll: 45
      [[Prototype]]: Object
  </pre>
    <h2> 5. What is prototype chain </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> So when we create an object and print the object  on console then an object is 
      printed in the screen and inside this object there is a prototype automatically created will be shown  
      when we click there there a constructor  and a inner  prototype created automatically which we do not 
      create but it is there. So starting from the object going to the prototype object and after that 
      going to the inner prototype object  and after that going to  prototype null this chain is called 
      prototype chaining. So the  chain which is formed here that is from 
      Student object   ---->   Prototype object   ---->   Inner prototype object---->  prototype null.
    </p>
     <pre class="pre">

      function Student(name, age, roll){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.roll = roll;
      }
      Student.prototype.Nationality = "American";
      let stu = new Student("Meenakshi",23,45);
      stu.Nationality = "Indian";
      console.log(stu);
     </pre>
     <p class="output">Output :</p>
     <pre>
      Student {name: 'Meenakshi', age: 23, roll: 45, Nationality: 'Indian'}
          Nationality: "Indian"
          age: 23
          name: "Meenakshi"
          roll: 45
          [[Prototype]]: Object
                Nationality: "American"
                constructor: ƒ Student(name, age, roll)
                [[Prototype]]: Object
                      constructor: ƒ Object()
                      hasOwnProperty: ƒ hasOwnProperty()
                      isPrototypeOf: ƒ isPrototypeOf()
                      propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ propertyIsEnumerable()
                      toLocaleString: ƒ toLocaleString()
                      toString: ƒ toString()
                      valueOf: ƒ valueOf()
                      __defineGetter__: ƒ __defineGetter__()
                      __defineSetter__: ƒ __defineSetter__()
                      __lookupGetter__: ƒ __lookupGetter__()
                      __lookupSetter__: ƒ __lookupSetter__()
                      __proto__: (...)
     </pre>
    <h2> 6. Give an example of inheritance using function constructor? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Inheritance is something when child is inheriting the properties of parents.
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      function Student(name, age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
      }
    
      function StudentDesc(name, age, id, cls){
        Student.call(this, name, age, id, cls);
        this.id = id;
        this.class = cls;
      }
      let stu1 = new Student("Meenakshi",24) 
      let stu2 = new StudentDesc("Meenu",24,105,'MCA')
      
      console.log(stu1);
      console.log(stu2);
    </pre>
    
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      Student { name: 'Meenakshi', age: 24 } 
      StudentDesc { name: 'Meenu', age: 24, id: 105, class: 'MCA' }
    </pre>
    <h2> 7. What are callbacks? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Function that is passed as an argument to another function is called as call back. 
      As JavaScript is an event driven language, which means they do not stop the program from running until 
      they are completed. So to stop the code to certain time limit and after that running that line of 
      code we can do using call backs. Some examples of callbacks are setTimeout,  setInterval and eventListener.
      Higher order function is the function which is accepting an another function has an argument
    </p>
    <pre class="pre">

      function callback(callback){
        console.log("Hii, Iam callback function");
        callback()
      }
      function show(){
        console.log("This will get printed after call back")
      }
      callback(show)
    </pre>
    <p class="output">Output :</p>
    <pre>
      Hii, Iam callback function
      This will get printed after call back
