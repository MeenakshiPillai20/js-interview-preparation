        <h1>Interview Questions</h1>
    <h2> 1. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators? </h2>
    <p> 
      <span> Ans.</span> ==  is equality operator and === is the strict equality operator. ==  checks 
      equality of values of the operands only and === checks equality of values and data types of the operands.
      Basically == does the type conversion of the operands before comparison where as === compare data 
      type as well because it doesn't convert the type before comparison.
    </p>
    <h2> 2. What is the spread operator? </h2>
    <p>
       <span> Ans.</span> Spread operator allows us to copy an existing array or object into another array or object. 
        It can be mainly used in many cases like when you want to expand, copy, concat with Math object,etc.
    </p>
    <h2> 3. What are the differences between var, let and const? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Var, let and const these are the keywords of JavaScript that we use to declare 
      variables or to  assign it to a variable. Var was initially used to declare variable when JavaScript 
      was introduced  and right now in newer versions we have let and const for declaring variables. 

      There are some basic differences
        
      The scope of var variable is global scope whereas The scope of let variable is block or local scope.
      and The scope of constant is also  block or local scope only. Var is global scope because we can access 
      variables from anywhere but let and const are restricted within the block

      Var variable can be modified, re-intialized re-declared into the scope whereas Let variable can 
      be modified but cannot be re-intialized, re-declared into the scope whereas Const variable cannot 
      be modified nor be re-intialized or re-declared into the scope.Const is initialised and declared 
      on the same time.
    </p>

    <h2> 4. What is execution context? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Execution context is used to describe how a code works inside JavaScript.Execution 
      context refers to the environment that allows JavaScript code to be executed. The execution context 
      determines which code, section has access to the code's functions, variables and objects.Everything 
      that happens inside the JavaScript happens in execution context. If write one line of code or 1000 
      line of code execution context always is created. Execution context have two parts that is creation 
      phase and execution phase. In creation phase we have code environment or component and memory component
      Inside creation phase we have memory component and inside execution phase we have code component. 
      Whenever we run a code a global execution context is being created in the call stack. Call stack 
      is also called control stack and runtime stack. So in creation phase that is the memory component, 
      all the variables and functions inside the code are assigned some memory that is undefined.
      Then inside the execution phase that is the code component if there is any variables defined with 
      some values will be assigned to the variable and if there is any function call then a new function 
      execution context is been created inside the global execution context inside the call stack.
      Whenever a function is called inside the code a new function execution context is been created 
      all the time and it would be removed on the basis of last in first out. If in the new  function 
      execution context there is some variable which is not defined then the compiler start searching 
      it inside the global execution context  or the parent execution context. This way inside call 
      stack after the global one by one function execution context created  and the code inside it get 
      executed after that it is it poped out in LIFO basis and finally global execution context also gets 
      removed at Las and finally we get our output.
    </p>
   
    <h2> 5. What is meant by first class functions? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> First class function is basically if a function in that language is treated like other variables. 
      So the functions can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or can be returned 
      by another function. JavaScript treat function as a first-class-citizen. This means that functions 
      are simply a value and just another type of object.
    </p>
   
    <h2> 6. What are closures? Give an example of closure? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Closure is a combination of inner function and lexical environment of outer function.In another words 
      closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript closures 
      are created every time a function is created, at functions creation time.
    </p>
   
    <h2> 7. Explain call( ), apply( ) and, bind( ) methods. Give an example of call( ), apply( ), bind( )? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Call, apply and bind these are just different way of calling or invoking  a function. When you are 
      calling a function using any of these then you don't have to define in the function that the first 
      argument will be an object.

      Call invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments one by one. Apply invokes the function 
      and allows you to pass in arguments as an array. Bind returns a new function, allows you to pass 
      in a array and any number of arguments.
    </p>
   
   
    <h2> 1. What is creation phase and execution phase? </h2>
    <p> 
      <span> Ans.</span> Everything that happens inside the JavaScript happens in execution context. Execution 
      context have two parts that is creation phase and execution phase. In creation phase we have code 
      environment or component and memory component. Inside creation phase we have memory component and 
      inside execution phase we have code component. Whenever we run a code a global execution context is 
      being created in the call stack. So in creation phase that is the memory component, all the variables 
      and functions inside the code are assigned some memory that is undefined. Then inside the execution 
      phase that is the code component if there is any variables defined with some values will be assigned 
      to the variable and if there is any function call then a new function execution context is been created 
      inside the global execution context inside the call stack. If in the new  function execution context 
      there is some variable which is not defined then the compiler start searching it inside the global 
      execution context  or the parent execution context. This way inside call stack after the global 
      execution stack by one function execution context created  and the code inside it get executed 
      after that it is poped out in LIFO basis and finally global execution context also gets removed 
      at last  and finally we get our output.
    </p>
    <h2> 2. What are objects in javascript? </h2>
    <p>
       <span> Ans.</span> In javascript,  Object is a non primitive data type that allows you to store 
       multiple collection of data in the form of key value pairs. Objects have many methods inside it 
       we can use in program to simplify our code. For-of loop does not work for object it will throw 
       and error if used. There are three different ways of creating objects:-    
       1.   By object literal 
       2.   By creating instance of object that is using new keyword 
       3.   By object constructor
    </p>
    <h2> 3. What are function constructors? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span>Function is said to be a constructor when it is used to initialise and create 
      a instance of class that is also called as object. It is a good practice to follow to keep the 
      first letter of function name capital. It is compulsory to use this and new keyword.
    </p>
    <h2> 4. Explain prototypes? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Prototype is a special type of object to which we can add additional properties 
      that can be accessed across the all the instances. Prototype is nothing but an object only. Prototype 
      also contains the object prototype inside it. Prototype is itself an object that have prototype object 
      present inside it.
    </p>
    <h2> 5. What is prototype chain </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> So when we create an object and print the object  on console then an object is 
      printed in the screen and inside this object there is a prototype automatically created will be shown  
      when we click there there a constructor  and a inner  prototype created automatically which we do not 
      create but it is there. So starting from the object going to the prototype object and after that 
      going to the inner prototype object  and after that going to  prototype null this chain is called 
      prototype chaining. So the  chain which is formed here that is from 
      Student object   ---->   Prototype object   ---->   Inner prototype object---->  prototype null.
    </p>
   
    <h2> 6. Give an example of inheritance using function constructor? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Inheritance is something when child is inheriting the properties of parents.
    </p>
    
    <h2> 7. What are callbacks? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Function that is passed as an argument to another function is called as call back. 
      As JavaScript is an event driven language, which means they do not stop the program from running until 
      they are completed. So to stop the code to certain time limit and after that running that line of 
      code we can do using call backs. Some examples of callbacks are setTimeout,  setInterval and eventListener.
      Higher order function is the function which is accepting an another function has an argument
    </p>
    <h2> 1. What is the use of setTimeout?</h2>
    <p> 
      <span> Ans.</span> The setTimeout() method executes a block of code after specified time. Basically 
      if we want a output after some specified time we can set the time for that block of code in the 
      setTimeout function and through this we can get the output with a delay of whatever time set. This 
      method executes the code only once and 1 second = 1000 millisecond.
    </p>
    <h2> 2. What is an event loop and call stack?</h2>
    <p>
       <span> Ans.</span> The setTimeout, setInterval, fetch, console these are not inbuild JavaScript 
       function. These are the part of web API to make JavaScript asynchronous and which are being given 
       by browser to JavaScript to perform some task. JavaScript does not have anything, it just have a 
       single thread or you can call it a main thread where it is executing the code all at once even if 
       it is a million lines of code.
    </p>
    <p>Event loop is nothing but a gatekeeper or a method that keeps on monitoring your call stack and call 
      back queue. If any task is there in call back queue that needs to be executed then  it checks in the 
      global execution context is there in call stack is empty or not, if empty then it pushes the task that 
      need to be exactuted into the call stack.</p>
    <p>Call stack is also called control stack and runtime stack. Everything happens in the JavaScript happens 
      in the execution context. When we run a specific code it create a global execution context inside 
      the call stack. In global execution context all the code get executed and if there is any function 
      call then a new function execution context will get created on call stack and the code inside that 
      will execute, if there is any other function call then another function execution context would be 
      created like this it would be going on. After that finally the code would get executed in the function 
      execution context then it would be poped out one by one on the basis of last in first out. This way all 
      the execution on call stack would be poped out and after we get the output the global execution context 
      will also be poped out from the call stack.</p>
    <h2> 3. What are arrow functions? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Arrow function is the newest feature introduced ES6 version of JS, to write simple 
      and manageable code that is easy to debug and understand.
    </p>
    <h2> 4. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> If you are accessing any variable before its declaration and that variable is 
      defined using let and const keywords then you will be getting a  reference error because the variable 
      is in temporal dead zone. To avoid Temporal dead zone, try to access a variable after its declaration 
      and initialisation.
    </p>
    <h2> 5. What is hoisting?</h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Hosting is a behaviour of JavaScript where all the variables are move of the top 
      of declaration. In other words we can say that we can use the variables and functions in JavaScript 
      before declaring them. Var keyword only support hoisting let and const keyword doesn't support hoisting.
    </p>
  
    <h2> 6. What is the DOM? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> DOM (Document object model), JavaScript support DOM as a structure of Hierarchy.
      Document = HTML  -> HEAD  and BODY. Methods to access the DOM elements are by id, by class name, 
      by tag name and by query selector. In query selector we can use ID, class and tag name.
    </p>
    <h2> 7. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> These all are the properties of JavaScript. 
      <p>Undefined is when we try to access a variable which is existing in the memory space but hasn't been 
        assigned any value till now. Basically if the variable is declared using var keyword, but not given 
        any value to it and we try to access it before declaring do we will get undefined.</p> 
      
      <p>Not defined is when we try to access a variable which is does not exist in memory space basically 
        if the value is not initialised or declared and we are still trying to access that variable using let 
        and const then we will get not defined.</p>
      
      <p>NAN is a data type when we are trying to access any string and number, to check if it is a string 
        or a number then it will throw you an NAN error.</p>
      
    </p>

    <h2> 1. How many operators do we have in JS?</h2>
    <p> 
      <span> Ans.</span> Operator can manipulate a certain value or operand. Operators are basically used to 
      perform some specific mathematical and logical computation on operands. In another words we can say that 
      operator operates the operands. There are many operators but few of them are Assignment, Arithmetic, 
      Logical, Relational, Bitwise, Comparison operator and many more...
    </p>
    <h2> 2. What are pure functions? </h2>
    <p>
       <span> Ans.</span> Pure function is a function that always returns the same result if the same 
       arguments are passed. In another words  it is a function that would give same or consistent output 
       if same input is being passed. It is nothing but a well defined function.
    </p>
    <h2> 3. What is callback hell? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Call back hell is a nested callback stacked below one another, in other words it 
      is a function that will execute after execution of its parent function is executed completely. It also 
      form pyramid like structure that is difficult to understand and debug. We should avoid using callback 
      hell as much as possible.
    </p>
    <h2> 4. What are promises and why do we need them? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Promises is like heaven for callbacks. It is introduced in ES6 version to handle 
      a asynchronous operations in an efficient way. It debug and manage code we need promises. It is 
      basically used to find out if the asynchronous operation is successfully completed or not. A promise 
      may have one of the three states that is pending, fulfilled or rejected. Promises allows us to write 
      cleaner code and allows error to pass down the chain and can be handled in a common place.
    </p>
    <h2> 5. What is promise chaining? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Promise chaining are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous 
      operation where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmageable code. To avoid callback 
      hell  we can use promise chaining. It is basically when multiple use of .then method are used.
    </p>
        <h2> 6. Give an example of async/await? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Async and await are introduced in ES8 version of JavaScript which return a promise. 
      Await is also a function which waits for a promise.
    </p>
 
    <h2> 7. What is the purpose of async/await keywords? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Async and await both are keywords which are basically brothers and sisters or 
      siblings basically wherever async keyword goes await follows it. To avoid using much promises we 
      have this best alternative basically to write the code in simplified manner that would make the code 
      more readable and understandable and to avoid callback hell and promises we use async and await.
    </p>

    <h2> 1. What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax?</h2>
    <p> 
      <span> Ans.</span> In JavaScript the for-in loop is a basic control statement that allows you to loop 
      through all the properties of an object. The statements of code found within the loop body will be 
      executed on once for each property of the object.
    </p>
    <p class="output"> Syntax :</p>
    <pre >

      for (variable in object){
        //statements
      }
    </pre>
    <h2> 2. Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript? </h2>
    <p>
       <span> Ans.</span> In global scope variables are declared outside of all functions are known as global 
        variables and in a global scope. Global variables are accessible anywhere in the program.
    </p>
    <p>In functional scope variables that are declared inside a function are called local variables and in a 
       functional scope. Local variables are accessible anywhere inside the function.</p>

    <p>Local scope it is basically similar to functional scope has local scope is defined inside functional 
       scope but inside brackets opening and closing { }.</p>

    <p>In block scope variable that are declared inside a specific block and can't be accessed outside of 
       the block. In order to access the variable of that specific block we need to create object for it.</p>

    <p>JavaScript engine uses scopes to find out the exact location or accessibility of variable that 
       particular process is known as scope chain.</p>

    <h2> 3. What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Null and undefined both are keywords used in JavaScript. Null is the intentional 
      absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript. Undefined means the value does 
      not exist in the compiler. It is the Global object.
    </p>
    <p>We use null when we have to define a variable and we have to make it programmatically empty and 
      undefined is used when we have to define the variable but don't have any use right now so we just 
      make that variable using var keyword and we don't not use it currently.</p>

    <h2> 4. what is Symbol? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Symbols are introduced in ES6 version of JavaScript a new primitive data type of 
      JavaScript like string,  number, boolean, etc. Basically symbol is a building object whose constructor 
      returns a symbol also called symbol value that guarantees to be unique and immutable 
      ( cannot be changed ). You can create symbol by calling the symbol ( )  Global factory function.
    </p>
    <h2> 5. Write code to explain map and filter in arrays? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Map method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function 
      to each one of the element of the first array. Filter method takes each element in an array and 
      it applies a conditional statement against it. If the conditional returns true, the elements get pushed 
      to the output array. If the condition return false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.
    </p>
    <h2> 6. Explain passed by value and passed by reference? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> In Pass by Value, function is called by directly passing the value of the variable 
      as an argument. Basically the parameter passed as an argument creates its own copy. So any changes made 
      inside the function is made to the copied value not to the original value. 
    </p>
    <p>In Pass by Reference function is called by directly passing the reference or address of the variable 
      as an argument. Basically parameter passed as an argument does not create its own copy, it refer to 
      an original value so changes made inside function affect the original value. In JavaScript array and 
      object follows Pass by Reference property.</p>

    <h2> 7. Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code? </h2>
    <p>
      <span> Ans.</span> Self-invoking functions also called self-executing functions these are nameless 
      anonymous function that is invoked immediately after its definition. These are enclosed inside a set 
      of parentheses followed by another set of parentheses  ( ), which does the execution.
